# CV_PaperNotes  
Mainly use markdown to summary the papers I've read.  

Issues are used to do short summaries and write some thoughts. 
And feel free to comment and talk with me at the issue page.   

Because of the taging function, each markdown file will have 
a issue page, too.    

The 'Welcome share' card pined at the top of issues page. It 
serves like a playground. Hope you can enjoy it.
